# Providence

Providence is a remorseful story about an unforgiving world. A world in which you must fight and emerge victorious against all odds. An immersive and original tale permeates the world around you, with thematic locations spread throughout Terraria, the Universe, and its realms. Explore the mystical atmosphere of our world, introducing an elemental system, new mechanics, new progression, new soundtracks, and our crafted visuals. Explore our subworlds; completely separate realms from the typical Terraria surroundings, extending the number of unique areas to discover. Experience entire realms with hidden treasures and evils, awaiting your discovery. Fight off new and unique bosses and experience the challenge that is our bullet hell design, optionally made even more challenging by our difficulty modifiers. 

**Warriors**, wielders of the **Primordial Flame**, infused with its wrath and resilience.

**Rangers**, wielders of the **Cosmos**, who uses the stars to imbue their attacks with untold power.

**Mages**, wielders of the **Prismatic Flare**, a master of all six elemental forces that they use to obliterate their foes.

**Summoners**, wielders of **Astrum**, who infuses their servants with the power of creation.

**Clerics**, wielders of **Parity Reality**, who bend the universe to their will to alternate between heal and harm.

**Rogues**, wielders of **Quantum Flux**, who bend space-time to inflict serious harm upon their foes and effortlessly evade attacks.

The world of Providence anticipates your attempts at survival, and despite how close you may come, there will always be another more unforgiving battle to fight.

Providence is a cruel world with an unforgiving story wreathed in flame and looming shadow. Your invigorating journey awaits you. The saddening story of the world has yet to reveal itself. Such a cruel fate for those who would stand in the way of change. Are you truly prepared for what lies ahead? The faint of heart should turn away, for those who lack courage will find no respite here. You will endure an unforgiving challenge.

You will suffer or die trying.

## Providence Mod

This is the source code for the ProvidenceMod project; A mod for Terraria via tModLoader.

A large-scale project planned to be an overhaul mod for Terraria. It delves deeper into the mechanics of Terraria while adding its own unique elements. We have several mechanics planned for implementation, as well two new classes; Cleric, and Rogue, and we have big plans for future additions, the scale of which you've likely seen in other big Terraria mods. This is a passion project, and so far our very small community of people has been helping us better our mod bit by bit with new content suggestions and other helpful contributions. While we might just be starting, it is said that there is a lot of promise and potential in our mod so far, and we are a dedicated and involved team of Devs working on making this dream a reality.

For many of us, myself included, this is our first project in CSharp. We've been learning the language over time and have grown very fond of it. We plan on seeing this project through, if not out of dedication, simply out of passion. We hope to influence others to learn with us as we take this project and its community to the next level.

## FAQ
**Why is this mod Open Source?**
   
   _One of our biggest hurdles when beginning to mod was finding accurate resources outside of the tModLoader GitHub, the tModLoader Discord, or Example Mod. Many forums or other resources were simply outdated or inaccurate. This inspired us to make our mod Open Source, not only because we want to act as a form of Example Mod in the sense that it is an example for people to follow, but also because this will be an overhaul mod, so there are plenty of examples to follow. We are also completely open to helping new modders learn CSharp and the tModLoader API._
   
**When am I allowed to adapt code from this mod?**

   _It should be mentioned that although this mod is open source, plagiarism is not okay. As cited in the tModLoader Wiki page about Open Source Mods:_

> _Remember, you can't just copy code from these mods unless the license they are under specifically allows it. If there is no license, the owner reserves all ownership and copyright of the code, so you need to contact the owner and ask permission to utilize certain parts. Don't worry, most will be happy to allow you to use portions of their code, but you still need to ask._

   _While we might allow most utilities to be copied, it is still important to ask us which code is safe to copy and which code is not. Remember, this is a mod that you use to LEARN, not copy and paste. If you learn the code you will never need to copy and paste from outside sources and we are more than willing to help you understand the code. There are bits of code, however, that we do list as "Free To Use", which means we are permitting you to use that code in your projects. That does not, however, pass off ownership of the code to you. So if someone asks about how it works or if you wrote it yourself, link them to this repository, because the chances are that they will benefit from seeing the original if they are asking those questions. You are doing yourself, them, and us a favor!_

**Where are the best places to contact the Developers?**
   
   _You may contact us through email or Github Issues. However, the best place to contact us is through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bhCuppRdVF)._

**How can I contribute?**

   _Any contributions are welcome. If you have ideas, the best place to send them to us is in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bhCuppRdVF). Sprites are always welcome, though it should be noted that you may benefit from contacting our team's spriters to work with them. If you want to suggest music, we suggest contacting our team's music artists to work with them. The best place to suggest code is by using GitHub issues, however, you should read our [Wiki page](https://github.com/ProvidenceMod/ProvidenceMod/wiki/Code) on code formatting before contributing code. Contributing lore is a bit trickier than the other three. This is where you might need to talk with our team since writing lore needs to be concise and sound with the rest of existing lore._
