I suggest a palette of at least 6 different colors.
Here is the basic outline to using this sprite sheet:


1. Make your designs by using the layers Tile 1, Tile 2, and Tile 3.
2. Make sure that the designs repeat fluidly, connecting on all sides seemlessly.
3. After you finish making your Tile designs, copy and paste each Tile layer over their respective Location layer
4. Next, select the Base layer, and with the Magic Wand tool selected, click on the transparency.
5. On each of your Tile layers, press the Delete key. This will delete any of the Tile that goes outside of the Base.
6. Now, select the Base layer again, and use the Color Picker tool to select one of the shades of Brown. This will be the dirt. (hold alt and click to select a color) 
7. On each of your tile layers, draw this color in each of the selected pixels. The easiest way to do this is by using a very big brush size.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for the other shade of brown.
9. Once you have the dirt colors drawn, select the Base layer, and with the Magic Wand tool selected, click the Dark Grey color.
10. On each of your Tile layers, draw in the darkest color of your palette, or whichever color is appropriate, into the selection.
11. At the top of Aseprite, click Sprite > Sprite Size, select Lock Ratio and replace 100% with 200%, and click OK.
12. Make sure that the Tiles in the bottom right of the sheet are transparent.
12. At the top of Aseprite, click File > Save As > PNG
13. Done!
