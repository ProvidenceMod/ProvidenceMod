This mod is a Pre-Alpha! It is also Open-Source. It is not finished and nor is the initial content. We would appreciate any and all support with making this project a reality. Scroll down for our Discord server and GitHub.

Providence is a remorseful story about an unforgiving world. A world in which you must fight and emerge victorious against all odds. An immersive and original tale permeates the world around you, with thematic locations spread throughout Terraria, the Universe, and its realms. Explore the mystical atmosphere of our world, introducing an elemental system, new mechanics, new progression, new soundtracks, and our handcrafted visuals. Explore our subworlds; completely separate realms from the typical Terraria surroundings, extending the number of unique areas to discover. Experience entire realms with hidden treasures and evils, awaiting your discovery. Fight off new and unique bosses and experience the challenge that is our bullet hell design, optionally made even more challenging by our difficulty modifiers.

Warriors, wielders of the Primordial Flame, infused with its wrath and resilience.

Rangers, wielders of the Cosmos, who use the stars to imbue their attacks with untold power.

Mages, wielders of the Prismatic Flare, masters of all six elemental forces which they use to obliterate their foes.

Summoners, wielders of Astrum, who infuse their servants with the power of the cosmos and call upon the aid of Astrid.

Clerics, wielders of Parity Reality, who bend the universe to their will to alternate between heal and harm.

Wraiths, wielders of Quantum Flux, who bend space-time to inflict serious harm upon their foes and effortlessly evade attacks.

The world of Providence anticipates your attempts at survival, and despite how close you may come, there will always be another more unrelenting battle to fight.

It is a cruel world with an unforgiving story wreathed in flame and looming shadow. Your invigorating journey awaits you. The saddening story of the world has yet to reveal itself. Such a cruel fate for those who would stand in the way of change. Are you truly prepared for what lies ahead? The faint of heart should turn away, for those who lack courage will find no respite here. You will endure an unforgiving challenge.

You will suffer. You will die.

This is the source code for the ProvidenceMod project; A mod for Terraria via tModLoader.

A large-scale project planned to be an overhaul mod for Terraria. We have several mechanics planned for implementation, as well two new classes; Cleric, and Wraith, and we have big plans for future additions, the scale of which you've likely seen in other big Terraria mods. This is a passion project, and so far our very small community of people has been helping us better our mod bit by bit with new content suggestions and other helpful contributions. While we might just be starting, it is said that there is a lot of promise and potential in our mod so far, and we are a dedicated and involved team of Devs working on making this dream a reality.

For many of us, myself included, this is our first project in CSharp. We've been learning the language over time and have grown very fond of it. We plan on seeing this project through, if not out of dedication, simply out of passion. We hope to influence others to learn with us as we take this project and its community to the next level.

Thank you so much for clicking on this mod! If you're interested or have any questions, we would love to have you in our Discord server!
